This is a nodejs template for setting up a static website using [motionless](https://github.com/chr15m/motionless).
You get a site built from Markdown, CSS, and an HTML template, and a live-reloading dev server that will update the site as you build it.

```
npm init motionless-site YOUR-APP-NAME
cd YOUR-APP-NAME
```

Then start the live-reloading dev server:

```
make watch
```

Now open <http://localhost:8000/> in your browser.

See [the README](./template/README.md) for documentation on using the template.
